# RedwoodCodingChallenge

This script takes a user input of a city and state and outputs the current weather in the city.

## Environment Setup
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6.1
* Anaconda 4.11.0
  
To recreate the virtual environment, run the following command inside the directory where this code is located.
```
conda env create -f env.yml
```
Then activate the virtual environment you just created.
```
conda activate venv-361
```
You can import requirements with this command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Script
The script can be run with the following command.
```
python get_forecast.py
```

## Future Work
If I continued to work on this project, I would spend more time working on the fuzzy matching. This was my first time working with fuzzy matching, and I think with time I could make better matches.

## Closing Remarks
Thank you for the opportunity to do this coding challenge!  
Best,
